### Update
- 2017/5/25 Try to replace ReLU with PReLU, if you can not adjust lambda to make the network converge. (I also mentioned this in the note.)
- 2017/1/23 Fix a bug that lambda_min may change during backprop. Thanks [luoyetx](https://github.com/luoyetx)
- 2017/1/23 A mxnet implementation is also available at [here](https://github.com/luoyetx/mx-lsoftmax). Credit goes to [luoyetx](https://github.com/luoyetx).

### Usage
- The prototxt of LargeMarginInnerProduct layer is as follows:

        layer {
          name: "ip2"
          type: "LargeMarginInnerProduct"
          bottom: "ip1"
          bottom: "label"
          top: "ip2"
          top: "lambda"
          param {
            name: "ip2"
            lr_mult: 1
          }
          largemargin_inner_product_param {
            num_output: 10 //number of outputs
            type: QUADRUPLE //value of m
            //only SINGLE (m=1), DOUBLE (m=2), TRIPLE (m=3) and QUADRUPLE (m=4) are available.
            base: 1000
            gamma: 0.000025
            power: 35
            iteration: 0
            lambda_min: 0
            //base, gamma, power and lambda_min are parameters of exponential lambda descent
            weight_filler {
              type: "msra"
            }
          }
          include {
            phase: TRAIN
          }
        }

### Notes
- L-Softmax loss is the combination of "LargeMarginInnerProduct" layer and "SoftmaxWithLoss" layer.
- If the type of the layer is SINGLE/DOUBLE/TRIPLE/QUADRUPLE, then m is set as 1/2/3/4 respectively.
- mnist example can be run directly after compilation. cifar10 and cifar10+ requires datasets to be downloaded first.
- base, gamma, power and lambda_min are parameters for exponential lambda descent. lambda represents the approximation level to the proposed L-Softmax loss (refer to the experimental details in the ICML'16 paper). lambda will be decreased by the equation: lambda = max(lambda_min,base\*(1+gamma\*iteration)^(-power)). It is strong recommended that the user visualizes the lambda descent function before using the loss. The parameter selection is very flexible. Typically, when the optimization is finished, lambda should a sufficiently small value. Also note that, lambda is not always necessary. For MNIST dataset, the L-Softmax loss can work perfectly without lambda. Setting base to 0 can remove the lambda.
- lambda_min can vary according to the difficulty of datasets. For easy datasets such as mnist and cifar10, lambda_min can be zero. For large and difficult datasets, you should first try to set lambda_min as 5 or 10. There is no specific rule to set lambda_min, but generally, it should be as small as possible.
- Both ReLU and PReLU work well with L-Softmax loss. Empirically, PReLU helps L-Softmax converge easier.
- Batch normalization could help the L-Softmax network converge much easier. It is strong recommended to use it.
