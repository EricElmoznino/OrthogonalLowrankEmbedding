# Experiments


[STL-10-Pytorch](stl10)  Contains experiments using small training data on STL-10 database. *(This is the simplest experiment to run, I recomend starting here)*

[Cifar10-Caffe](caffe_OLE) Contains experiments on CIFAR10 using Caffe and a VGG-16 architecture

[Facescrub500-Caffe](caffe_Facescrub500) Contains experiments on face dataset Facescrub500 

[Cifar10-Pytorch](pytorch_OLE) Contains experiments on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 for various architectures.
